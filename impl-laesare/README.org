* SRFI 243 laesare implementation

This is a sample implementation of SRFI 243 for GÃ¶ran Weinholt's
"laesare" library. Laesare is a Scheme tokenizer, reader, and writer
that runs on R6RS. It can read and write R6RS and R7RS syntax.

The patch teaches the laesare reader to recognize two new kinds of
lexical syntax:

- Unreadable data with ~#<~ syntax. The data after ~#<~ cannot be parsed.

- Unreadable object with ~#?foo~ syntax, where ~foo~ is any datum.

Requirements:

- The git and patch Unix utilities.
- Akku, the Scheme package manager.
- Akku-compatible R6RS Scheme implementation, e.g. Chez Scheme.

Running:

#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone https://gitlab.com/weinholt/laesare.git
cd laesare
git checkout v1.0.1
patch --strip 1 <../laesare-1.0.1-unreadable.patch
akku install
.akku/env ./run-tests.sh
#+END_SRC
